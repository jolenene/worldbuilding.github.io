         The story of Rajneeshpuram ultimately extends well before and long after the brief experiment in Oregon. 
         It is impossible, for example, to understand the success of this movement without situating Rajneesh in 
         the context of India during the late 1960s, as thousands of young hippies were beginning to flood into the 
         country in search of quick enlightenment and/or cheap drugs, while also mixing in their own ideas drawn from 
         Western psychology and the sexual revolution. Rajneesh himself was also an outspoken social and political critic, 
         attacking the socialist policies of Nehru and the religious prudery of Gandhi, while also calling for India to 
         open its doors to Western capitalism. The move to Oregon was thus a fulfillment of his larger ideal of wedding 
         East and West—what he called “Zorba the Buddha”—by bringing together the spirituality of the Buddha with the 
         materialism and sensuality of Zorba the Greek. In this sense, Rajneesh was really one of the first truly “global gurus” 
         of the modern era, tracing a complex circuit from India to the U.S. and back again, while also synthesizing 
         Eastern philosophy with American-style capitalism. </pre>

With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city
Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. The ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the
streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown
gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved.
