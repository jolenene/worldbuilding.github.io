    <h1>Afterword</h1>
    <h3>By Louise Glück</h3>
    <p><br>Reading what I have just written, I now believe</br>
        <br>I stopped precipitously, so that my story seems to have been</br>
        <br>slightly distorted, ending, as it did, not abruptly</br>
        <br>but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort</br>
        <br>sprayed onto stages to allow for difficult set changes.</br>
        
        <br>Why did I stop? Did some instinct</br>
        <br> discern a shape, the artist in me</br>
        <br>intervening to stop traffic, as it were?</br>
        
        <br> A shape. Or fate, as the poets say,</br>
        <br> intuited in those few long ago hours—</br>
        
        <br>I must have thought so once.</br>
        <br> And yet I dislike the term</br>
        <br>which seems to me a crutch, a phase,</br>
        <br>the adolescence of the mind, perhaps—</br>
        
        <br>Still, it was a term I used myself,</br>
        <br>frequently to explain my failures.</br>
        <br>Fate, destiny, whose designs and warnings</br>
        <br>now seem to me simply</br>
        <br>local symmetries, metonymic</br>
        <br>baubles within immense confusion—</br>
        
        <br>Chaos was what I saw.</br>
        <br>My brush froze—I could not paint it.</br>
        
        <br>Darkness, silence: that was the feeling.</br>
        
        <br>What did we call it then?</br>
        <br>A “crisis of vision” corresponding, I believed,</br>
        <br>to the tree that confronted my parents,</br>
        
        <br>but whereas they were forced</br>
        <br>forward into the obstacle,</br>
        <br>I retreated or fled—</br>
        
        <br>Mist covered the stage (my life).</br>
        <br>Characters came and went, costumes were changed,</br>
        <br>my brush hand moved side to side</br>
        <br>far from the canvas,</br>
        <br>side to side, like a windshield wiper.</br>
